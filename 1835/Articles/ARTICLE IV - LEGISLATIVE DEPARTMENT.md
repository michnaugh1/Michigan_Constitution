Census, time of taking; apportionment of legislative members.

3. The Legislature shall provide by law for an enumeration of the inhabitants of this state in the years on thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, and one thousand eight hundred and forty-five, and every ten years after the said last mentioned time: and at their first session after each enumeration so made as aforesaid, and also after each enumeration made by the authority of the United States, the legislature shall apportion anew the representatives and senators among the several counties and districts, according to the number of white inhabitants.

4. The representatives shall be chosen annually on the first Monday of November, and on the following day, by the electors of the several counties or districts into which the State shall be divided for that purpose.

Same; senator.

5. The Senators shall be chosen for two years, at the same time and in the same manner as the representatives are required to be chosen.

The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the first year, and of the second class at the expiration of the second year: so that one-half thereof, as nearly as may be, shall be chosen annually thereafter.

Senatorial districts.

6. The State shall be divided, at each new apportionment, into a number of not less than four nor more than eight senatorial districts, to be always composed on contiguous territory; so that each district shall elect an equal number of senators annually, as nearly as may be: and no county shall be divided in the formation of such districts.

Quorum, adjournment, attendance, officers.

10. A majority of each house shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner and under such penalties, as each house may provide. Each house shall choose its own officers.

Rules; each house judge of election of its members.

11. Each house shall determine the rules of its proceedings, and publish the same, except such parts as may require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either house, on any question, shall, at the request of one-fifth of the members present, be entered on the journal. Any member of either house shall have liberty to dissent from and protest against, any act or resolution which he may think injurious to the public or an individual, and have the reasons of his dissent entered on the journal.

Same; consideration by governor; reconsideration by legislature; pocket veto.

16. Every bill passed by the legislature shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the governor; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not, he shall return it, with his objections, to that house in which it originated, who shall enter the objections at large upon their journal, and proceed to reconsider it; if, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of all the members present agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent with the objections to the other house, by whom it shall likewise be reconsidered and if approved also by two-thirds of all members present in that house, it shall become a law; but in such cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the members voting for or against the bill shall be entered on the journals of each house respectively: And if any bill be not returned by the governor within ten days, Sundays excepted, after it has been presented to him, the same shall become a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the legislature by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not become a law.

Resolution treated as bills; exception.

17. Every resolution to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary, except in cases of adjournment, shall be presented to the governor, and, before the same shall take effect, shall be proceeded upon in the same manner as in the case of a bill.

Compensation; increase.

18. The members of the legislature shall receive for their services a compensation to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the public treasury but no increase of the compensation shall take effect during the term for which members of either house shall have been elected; and such compensation shall never exceed three dollars a day.
