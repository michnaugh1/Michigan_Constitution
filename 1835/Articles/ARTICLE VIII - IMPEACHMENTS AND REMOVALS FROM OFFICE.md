Same; procedure.

2. All impeachments shall be tried by the Senate. When the Governor or lieutenant Governor shall be tried, the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall preside. Before the trial of an impeachment, the members of the court shall take an oath or affirmation, truly and impartially to try and determine the charge in question, according to the evidence; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office; but the party convicted shall be liable to indictment and punishment according to law.

Power of governor to remove judges.

3. For any reasonable cause, which shall not be sufficient ground for the impeachment of the judges of any of the Courts, the Governor shall remove any of them on the address of two-thirds of the legislature; but the cause, or causes for which such removal may be required, shall be stated at length in the address.

Removal of county and township officers.

4. The legislature shall provide by law for the removal of justices of the peace and other county and township officers, in such manner, and for such cause, as to them shall seem just and proper.
