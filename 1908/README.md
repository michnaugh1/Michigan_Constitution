LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT

Legislative power; initiative; referendum.

Sec. 1. The legislative power of the state of Michigan is vested in a senate and house of representatives; but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose legislative measures, resolutions and laws; to enact or reject the same at the polls independently of the legislature; and to approve or reject at the polls any act passed by the legislature, except acts making appropriations for state institutions and to meet deficiencies in state funds. The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Qualified and registered electors of the state equal in number to at least 8 per cent of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor, at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected, shall be required to propose any measure by petition: Provided, That no law shall be enacted by the initiative that could not under this constitution be enacted by the legislature. Initiative petition shall set forth in full the proposed measure, and shall be filed with the secretary of state or such other person or persons as may hereafter be authorized by law to receive same not less than 10 days before the commencement of any session of the legislature. Every petition shall be certified to as herein provided as having been signed by the required number of qualified and registered electors, and may, in determining the validity thereof, cause any doubtful signatures to be checked against the registration records by the clerk of any political subdivision in which said petitions were circulated, for properly determining the authenticity of such signatures. If the same has been so signed, the secretary of state or other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to receive and canvass same determines that the petition is legal and in proper form and has been signed by the required number of qualified and registered electors, such petition shall be transmitted to the legislature as soon as it convenes and organizes. The law proposed by such petition shall be either enacted or rejected by the legislature without change or amendment within 40 days from the time such petition is received by the legislature.

If any law proposed by such petition shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be subject to referendum, as hereinafter provided. If any law so petitioned for be rejected, or if no action is taken upon it by the legislature within said 40 days, the secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law shall submit such proposed law to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election. The legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different measure upon the same subject by a yea and nay vote upon separate roll calls, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to the electors for approval or rejection at the next ensuing general election. All said initiative petitions last above described shall have printed thereon in 12 point black face type the following: "Initiative measure to be presented to the legislature."

The legislature may prescribe penalties for causing or aiding and abetting in causing any fictitious or forged name to be affixed to any initiative or referendum petition bearing fictitious or forged names to be circulated.

The second power reserved to the people is the referendum. No act passed by the legislature shall go into effect until 90 days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature which passed such act, except such acts making appropriations and such acts immediately necessary of the preservation of the public peace, health or safety, as have been given immediate effect by action of the legislature. Upon presentation to the secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law, within 90 days after the final adjournment of the legislature, of a petition certified to as herein provided, as having been signed by qualified and registered electors equal in number to 5 per cent of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last election at which a governor was elected, asking that any act, section or part of any act of the legislature be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection, the secretary of state or other person or persons hereafter authorized by law, shall canvass said petition to ascertain if the same is signed by the requisite number of qualified and registered law may, in determining the validity thereof, cause any doubtful signatures to be which said petitions were circulated, for properly determining the authenticity of such signatures. If the secretary of state or such other person or persons hereafter authorized by law to receive and canvass the same determines that the petition is legal and in proper form and has been signed by the required number of qualified and registered electors, he shall then submit to the electors for approval or rejection such act or section or part of any act at the next succeeding general election; and no such act shall go into effect until and unless approved by a majority of the qualified and registered electors voting thereon. An official declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition shall be made by the secretary of state or such other person or persons as shall hereafter be authorized at least 2 months prior to such election.

Any act submitted to the people by either initiative or referendum petition and approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon at any election shall take effect 10 days after the date of the official declaration of the vote by the secretary of state. No act initiated or adopted by the people, shall be subject to the veto power of the governor, and no act adopted by the people at the polls under the initiative provisions of this section shall be amended or repealed, except by a vote of the electors unless otherwise provided in said initiative measure, but the legislature may propose such amendments, alterations or repeals to the people. Acts adopted by the people under the referendum provision of this section may be amended by the legislature at any subsequent session thereof: Provided, however, If 2 or more measures approved by the electors at the same election conflict, the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail. The text of all measures to be submitted shall be published as constitutional amendments are required by law to be published.

Any initiative or referendum petition may be presented in sections, each section containing a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed measure. Each signer thereto shall add to his signature, his place of residence, street names and also residence numbers in cities and villages having street numbers, and date of signing the same. Any qualified and registered elector of the state shall be competent to solicit such signatures within the county or city in which it is circulated, and only qualified and registered electors of such county or city shall be competent to sign such section. Each section shall have attached thereto the affidavit of the person soliciting signatures to the same, who shall be required to identify himself by affixing his address below his signature, stating that he is a qualified and registered elector and that all the signatures to the attached section were made in his presence, that each signature to the section is the genuine signature of the person signing the same, and no other affidavit thereto shall be required.

Each section of the petition shall be filed with the clerk of the county in which it was circulated, but all said sections circulated in any county shall be filed at the same time. Within 20 days after the filing of such petition in his office, the said clerk shall forward said petition to the secretary of state or such other person or persons as shall hereafter be authorized by law.

In that event the state shall loan the excess amount to the school district for the payment of principal and interest. If for any reason any school district will be or is unable to pay the principal and interest on its qualified bonds when due, then the school district shall borrow and the state shall loan to it any amount sufficient to enable the school district to make the payment.

In any year when such a levy would produce an amount in excess of the requirements and the amount due to the state, the levy may be reduced by the amount of the excess.

Subject to the foregoing provisions, the legislature shall have the power to prescribe and/or limit the procedure, terms and conditions for the qualification of bonds, for obtaining and making state loans, and for the repayment of loans.

The power to tax for the payment of principal and interest on bonds hereafter issued which are the general obligations of any school district, including refunding bonds, and for repayment of any state loans made pursuant to this section, shall be without limitation as to rate or amount.

All rights acquired under section 27 of this article by holders of bonds issued prior to July 1, 1962, shall remain unimpaired.
