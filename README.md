The State of Michigan has adopted four Constitutions in its history. Below is from History of Michigan's Constitutions from the Michigan Legislature. Available at: https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/Publications/Constitution.pdf 

This project was inspired by the github page of a history of the United States Constitution by JesseKPhillips available at: https://github.com/JesseKPhillips/USA-Constitution 

The Constitution of 1835 was adopted two years before Michigan became a state. The Constitutional Convention of 1835 met at the Territorial Capitol in Detroit on May 11, 1835, and adjourned on June 24, 1835. The Constitution of 1835 was adopted at an election held on October 5 and 6, 1835, by a vote of 6,752 to 1,374.

On June 3, 1850, a Constitutional Convention met at Lansing and completed its revision on August 15. The Constitution of 1850 was presented at the election of November 5, 1850, and adopted by a vote of 36,169 to 9,433. 

Over fifty years passed before a new Constitution was adopted. On October 22, 1907, a Constitutional Convention convened at Lansing and completed its revision on March 3, 1908. The Constitution of 1908 was adopted on November 3, 1908, by a vote of 244,705 to 130,783.

Four attempts were made to call a Constitutional Convention for the purpose of revising the Constitution of 1908 before the question was approved by the voters on April 3, 1961. A primary election for the purpose of electing delegates was held on July 25, 1961, and on September 12, 1961, one hundred forty-four delegates were elected. The delegates met at Convention Hall in the Civic Center, Lansing, on October 3, 1961, and adopted the proposed Constitution on August 1, 1962. The Constitution was submitted at the election of April 1, 1963, and adopted. A recount established the vote as 810,860 to 803,436. The effective date of the Constitution of 1963 is January 1, 1964.
